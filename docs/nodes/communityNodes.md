# Community Nodes

These are nodes that have been developed by the community for the community. If you're not sure what a node is, you can learn more about nodes [here](overview.md).

If you'd like to submit a node for the community, please refer to the [node creation overview](overview.md).

To download a node, simply download the `.py` node file from the link and add it to the `invokeai/app/invocations/` folder in your Invoke AI install location. Along with the node, an example node graph should be provided to help you get started with the node. 

To use a community node graph, download the the `.json` node graph file and load it into Invoke AI via the **Load Nodes** button on the Node Editor.
