# Tutorials

Tutorials help new & existing users expand their abilty to use InvokeAI to the full extent of our features and services.  

Currently, we have a set of tutorials available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@invokeai), but as InvokeAI continues to evolve with new updates, we want to ensure that we are giving our users the resources they need to succeed. 

Tutorials can be in the form of videos or article walkthroughs on a subject of your choice. We recommend focusing tutorials on the key image generation methods, or on a specific component within one of the image generation methods.
