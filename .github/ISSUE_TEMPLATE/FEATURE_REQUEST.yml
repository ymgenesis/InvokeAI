        Instead of one huge text field, it would be nice to have forms for bug-reports, feature-requests, ...
        Great benefits with automatic labeling, assigning and other functionalitys not available in that form
        via old-fashioned markdown-templates. I would also love to see the use of a moderator bot ðŸ¤– like
        https://github.com/marketplace/actions/issue-moderator-with-commands to auto close old issues and other things
