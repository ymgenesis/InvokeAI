InvokeAI

Project homepage: https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI

Preparations:

  You will need to install Python 3.9 or higher for this installer
  to work. Instructions are given here:
  https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/installation/INSTALL_AUTOMATED/

  Before you start the installer, please open up your system's command
  line window (Terminal or Command) and type the commands:

     python --version

  If all is well, it will print "Python 3.X.X", where the version number
  is at least 3.9.*, and not higher than 3.11.*.

  If this works, check the version of the Python package manager, pip:

     pip --version

  You should get a message that indicates that the pip package
  installer was derived from Python 3.9 or 3.10. For example:
  "pip 22.3.1 from /usr/bin/pip (python 3.9)"

Long Paths on Windows:

  If you are on Windows, you will need to enable Windows Long Paths to
  run InvokeAI successfully. If you're not sure what this is, you
  almost certainly need to do this.

  Simply double-click the "WinLongPathsEnabled.reg" file located in
  this directory, and approve the Windows warnings. Note that you will
  need to have admin privileges in order to do this.

Launching the installer:

  Windows: double-click the 'install.bat' file (while keeping it inside
  the InvokeAI-Installer folder).

  Linux and Mac: Please open the terminal application and run
  './install.sh' (while keeping it inside the InvokeAI-Installer
  folder).

The installer will create a directory of your choice and install the
InvokeAI application within it. This directory contains everything you need to run
invokeai. Once InvokeAI is up and running, you may delete the
InvokeAI-Installer folder at your convenience.
